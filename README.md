# ‚ö° Speed Control of Separately Excited DC Motor using Single Phase Semi-Converter

This project demonstrates the simulation and analysis of a **separately excited DC motor** controlled using a **single-phase semi-converter**. The main objective is to achieve effective and smooth speed control by varying the firing angle of the converter using MATLAB/Simulink.


## üìå Introduction

Separately excited DC motors are commonly used in applications where precise speed control is essential. A **single-phase semi-converter** allows partial conversion of AC to controlled DC, making it possible to regulate motor speed by adjusting the firing angle. This simulation models the interaction between the converter and the motor to provide a practical insight into real-world performance.
